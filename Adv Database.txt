There are three basic techniques to model inheritance in the context of object-oriented programming: single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and interface inheritance. Each approach has its own set of pros and cons.

Single Inheritance

Pros
Simplicity: It is simple to comprehend and use single inheritance. A class can only derive from one superclass, which simplifies the code.
Avoids Diamond Problem: A typical difficulty in many inheritance scenarios, the "diamond problem," is automatically avoided by single inheritance.
Clear Hierarchy: It requires a distinct hierarchy of classes, which makes code structure and maintenance easier to handle.

Cons
Limited Reusability: A class may not be able to reuse functionality from various sources since it can only inherit from one superclass, which might result in code duplication.
Less Flexibility: It may restrict the available design alternatives, particularly in cases when multiple inheritance would be a more sensible modeling approach.

Multiple Inheritance:

Pros
High Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance enables a class to inherit properties and functions from many superclasses, enhancing code reuse and minimizing duplication.
Flexibility: It offers greater design freedom, enabling the construction of intricate class hierarchies that faithfully reflect actual connections.
Expressive: Multiple inheritance can more naturally and correctly represent complicated connections than a single inheritance.

Cons
Diamond Problem: The "diamond problem," which arises when a class derives from two classes that share a base class, is the most important flaw. This calls for cautious treatment because it might cause uncertainty in method resolution.
Complexity: When there are several base classes and deep hierarchies, multiple inheritance can make the code more convoluted and challenging to comprehend.
Name Conflicts: When two or more superclasses declare methods or attributes with the same name, a name conflict may occur.

Interface Inheritance 

Pros
Decoupling: By establishing a contract that implementing classes must abide by, interface inheritance fosters decoupling between classes. This improves the testability and modularity of the code.
Flexibility: It permits the implementation of various interfaces by a class, providing some of the advantages of multiple inheritance without the complications and ambiguities.
Standards are enforced: By ensuring that classes follow certain standards or protocols, interfaces improve the dependability of the code.

Cons
No Code Reusability: Since interface inheritance does not offer code implementation, it does not, by itself, support code reuse. The code for the interface methods must still be written by implementing classes.
Limited Functionality: Because interfaces only specify method signatures, they are unable to offer shared code or default implementations, which might result in duplication.
Boilerplate Code: When implementing numerous interfaces, boilerplate code may occur, especially if many classes must implement similar methods from various interfaces.
